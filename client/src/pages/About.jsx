      content: `The Note-Making Application is a feature-rich and secure platform
          developed by Ishan, a skilled MERN stack developer, to streamline the
          process of managing personal notes. This application provides robust
          user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT),
          ensuring a secure experience. Users can register and log in to access
          their personal dashboard, where their notes are stored privately.
          Every note is linked to its respective owner, guaranteeing that only
          the user can create, edit, or delete their content. Unauthorized users
          have restricted access and can only view public notes, maintaining a
          balance between privacy and accessibility.

          styling could be further improved with Tailwind CSS or Material-UI for
          a polished look, while advanced error-handling middleware in the
          backend ensures smooth operation. With plans for deployment on
          platforms like Render, users can access the application conveniently
          from anywhere. Version control is managed via GitHub, ensuring
          continuous improvement and collaboration. Developed with a focus on
